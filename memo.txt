Notes to myself:

Attempts were made to cythonize various forms of the Hamiltonian, but ready to abandon for now. However:

Currently kuprov_cython.ipynb is the focus of interest. Non-fancy Kuprov code was surprisingly fast. Ways to vectorize
the loops with numpy were found as will, but the initial tests indicated they were slower than Kuprov.

TODO: compare Kuprov to my old code
TODO: compare Kuprov to my vectorized code
TODO: compare Kuprov to my "pre-saved partial solution" code
TODO: dial in on a fastest solution based on these speed test results
